I am personally a huge fan of the [Knack Database Software](https://www.knack.com/). I used it to create an internal employee portal that tracks data from timesheets, expense reports, invoices, and bills.

As an R enthusiast, I have sought ways to remotely access and analyze data stored on Knack using R. The Knack team has made that possible through their API, but the documentation is written in JavaScript and can be difficult to translate into R for those not familiar with HTTP requests and JSON.

I posted two articles on the Knack Forum about accessing Knack data using R. You can read about them [here](https://forums.knack.com/u/marcus/activity). I want to discuss my second post: *Sending filtered API Requests to Knack.*

Suppose you have thousands of records stored on Knack, but you only want to fetch a subset of them to analyze with R. Knack has made that possible through their API, but the documentation is written in JavaScript. I want to share how I translated the JavaScript into R code. You can see below the code that I used to retrieve only records specified within a date range.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Load dependent packages
library(jsonlite)
library(httr)

# Set the api base url
api_url <-
  "https://api.knack.com/v1/objects/object_23/records"

# Set boundaries for date range
# The date formatting is necessary
date_start <- format(as.Date('2021-11-01'), "%m/%d/%Y")
date_end <- format(as.Date('2021-11-30'), "%m/%d/%Y")

# Set filters
# Refer to the Knack Documentation for more details
filters <- list(match = "and",
                rules = data.frame(
                  field = "field_170",
                  operator = c("is after", "is before"),
                  value = c(date_start, date_end)
                ))

# Convert filters list to JSON and URL encode
filters_string <- toJSON(filters, auto_unbox = TRUE)
api_url <-
  paste0(api_url,
         '?rows_per_page=1000&filters=',
         URLencode(filters_string))

# Send the GET request
result <- GET(
  api_url,
  add_headers(
    "X-Knack-Application-Id" = "YOUR APP ID",
    "X-Knack-REST-API-Key" = "YOUR APP API KEY"
  )
)

# Retrieve the result
data <- fromJSON(content(result, as = "text"))
```

The trick is to make use of the `jsonlite` package which allows me to convert lists and data frames into JavaScript objects. Then, using the `URLencode` function from the `utils` package, we can create the proper API URL to send to Knack and retrieve the desired records.

You can perform such filters as retrieving records that contain a certain string, match a certain value, fall within a date range, and many more options. All the possibilities can be found in the [Knack Documentation](https://docs.knack.com/docs/filters-field-types).

And thatâ€™s it! If you have any questions about how to change the code to suit your specific needs, please feel free to leave me a comment. Thank you for reading!
